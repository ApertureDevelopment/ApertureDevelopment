# Hello there, curious traveler! üëã

## üìñ About me

Welcome to my profile! I'm Maximilian Gr√ºttemeier, Founder and CEO of [@Aperture-Development](https://github.com/Aperture-Development) ‚Äî but you might also know me as *Rainbow Dash* or simply as *Aperture Development*.

I'm 26 years old, born in Herford, Germany, but raised in the lovely town of Bad Salzuflen. My passion for technology sparked early on, but things really took off in 2014 when I discovered a "small" game called Garry's Mod (spoiler: I spent way too many hours in it). Curiosity got the better of me, and I started tinkering with addons, which led me down the rabbit hole of development, databases, and web design. Before I knew it, I was knee-deep in SQL, PHP, and full-stack development‚Äîand I‚Äôve been hooked ever since.

Fast forward to 2023, I officially turned my passion into a profession by starting an apprenticeship as a C#/.NET Developer at c-trace GmbH.

When I'm not writing code, you‚Äôll probably find me experimenting with new software in my homelab, riding my bike to burn off all the snacks, or geeking out over physics (purely as a hobby‚Äîno quantum mechanics dissertations here, I promise).

Over the years, I‚Äôve built a strong expertise in software development, web design, and database architecture, but I firmly believe that learning never stops. Technology evolves, and so do I‚Äîconstantly exploring, improving, and sharing knowledge with others.

Thanks for stopping by! I hope you enjoyed this little introduction‚Äîand if not, well, at least you got this far! üòÑ
